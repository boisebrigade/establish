# Establish

This repository contains the code for all aspects of the Establish application including:
* the [self rescue manual](http://www.selfrescuemanual.com/), a VueJS app
* the [establish](), a React-based PWA. 

* Contentful is currently being used as a 'backend-as-a-service' (BAAS) for both apps.

## Project Setup
See the separate README's within each of the project's component folders.
